# Epitech Actions
This workflow will build your unit tests and check the coding style in your repository when pushing any new changes.

# How to setup ?
1. Download the `install_epitech_actions.sh`
2. Go to the folder you just downloaded it
3. Do `chmod +x ./install_epitech_actions.sh` if you don't have the permission to execute it
4. Do `./install_epitech_actions.sh <path>` to install the workflow to the given path

# How to cancel commit on tests fails ?
When installing the workflows using `install_epitech_actions.sh`
The script will ask if you want to add branch protection. Write `y` for *yes* or `n` for *no*
It will install Github API on your device and will open in most case a window in your browser to login in with your current Github account
When logged in, the script will automatically add the protection for you

Enjoy! üíù
